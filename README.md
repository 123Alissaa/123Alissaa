# 👋 hey there!

i'm alissa, a cs student at USF who gets weirdly excited about making databases go fast and building things that actually work in production.

## 🎯 quick stats

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**currently building:**
- ai-powered recipe system for a robot 🤖
- real-time collaborative tools
- automation scripts (because manual work? no thanks)

**recently achieved:**
- 73% faster database queries
- 99.8% system uptime
- grew a student org from 60→200 people with one python script

</td>

**tech i vibe with:**
```python
favorites = {
  'languages': ['python', 'typescript', 'java'],
  'backend': ['fastapi', 'node.js', 'websockets'],
  'data': ['postgresql', 'mongodb'],
  'currently_learning': ['llms', 'distributed systems']

## 🚀 stuff i've built

### [💬 collabpad](https://github.com/123Alissaa/collabpad) - when you want google docs but for code
> real-time collaborative editor that doesn't lag

**the cool parts:**
- ⚡ sub-50ms latency (yes, i timed it)
- 👥 25+ people coding together without chaos
- 🎯 99.2% conflict resolution
- 📊 handles 3,500+ messages/min
- 🚀 optimized postgres queries 73% faster

built this to understand how notion/figma do real-time collaboration. learned way too much about websockets and concurrency.

**stack:** fastapi • websockets • postgresql • next.js

---

### [🤖 ai interview coach](https://github.com/123Alissaa/ai-interview-coach) - practice interviews with a local llm
> because practicing alone is weird

**what it does:**
- 🧠 runs mistral 7b locally (no cloud needed)
- ⚡ 40% faster through async magic
- 🎯 reduced ai hallucinations from 30% → 5%
- 📈 real-time performance monitoring

turned out prompt engineering is like debugging but for ai. also learned that llms are confidently wrong about things.

**stack:** python • ollama • streamlit • plotly

---

### [🛒 e-commerce thing](https://github.com/123Alissaa/ecommerce) - distributed transactions that don't break
> practicing microservices without the enterprise complexity

**highlights:**
- 💳 acid transactions (no double-charging)
- ⚡ 68% faster checkout (1.2s → 380ms)
- 🏗️ microservices architecture
- ✅ 85% test coverage (i actually write tests!)

learned that preventing race conditions in payment systems is harder than it looks.

**stack:** typescript • node.js • graphql • postgresql

## 💼 what i do

**backend engineer @ RARE Lab** *(aug 2025 - now)*

building production ai systems:
- integrated google's gemini api for a robot
- processing 200+ requests, generating 150+ ai outputs
- improved reliability from 80% → 97%
- debugging race conditions in distributed systems

**vp @ bridges international** *(apr 2025 - now)*

leading a team supporting 200+ students:
- built python automation (3 hours → 30 min)
- scaled org from 60 to 200 members
- learned that automation > manual work, always

**instructor @ girls who code** *(aug 2024)*

taught 40 high schoolers that coding isn't scary:
- made oop and algorithms actually fun
- grew attendance 60% (25→40 students)
- discovered i like teaching

## 🔍 things i'm good at

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ making things fast</b></summary>

i see slow code and immediately want to optimize it:
- 73% query speedup (45ms → 12ms)
- 68% checkout optimization (1.2s → 380ms)
- 40% latency reduction in async pipelines

basically if it takes more than 100ms i'm already thinking about how to make it faster.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 debugging production issues</b></summary>

reduced api failures from 20% to 3% by:
- finding race conditions in concurrent code
- implementing proper error handling
- adding monitoring and logging
- testing edge cases

peak debugging time: 2am. don't ask why.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🏗️ building real-time systems</b></summary>

websockets, async processing, state management:
- sub-50ms latency for real-time collaboration
- handling thousands of messages per minute
- conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- 99.2% automatic conflict detection

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 working with llms</b></summary>

practical ai/ml experience:
- integrated google gemini api in production
- ran mistral 7b locally for ai coaching
- reduced hallucinations through prompt engineering
- built monitoring dashboards for ai systems
